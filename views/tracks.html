    <p class="tracks-text">Behaviour can be defined as the action of one entity in response to another. But, acting alone, the effect of singular units is limited. From molecular structures to cellular communication and complex ecosystems, the coordinated actions of functional units, to a common impulse, result in emergent behaviours. These behaviours not only determine functional identity, but are also required to maintain dynamic stability within a population. Some of these phenomena cannot be predicted from the actions of individual members and research is expanding beyond single entities into deciphering the influence of interaction across biological scales. How does complexity arise and what approaches are currently being used to link individual actions to their ultimate consequence? Through a series of talks and discussions we aim to provide insight from multiple areas of research on this question and unravel the vast range of effects arising from collective behaviour. Join us in exploring the underlying mechanisms extending from sub-cellular environments to global ecology and evolutionary contexts.</p>
