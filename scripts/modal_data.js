We study the causes and consequences of gene dosage alterations and their impact on developmental, evolutionary and ageing processes. A major interest lies in the evolution of sex chromosomes and molecular diversity of compensatory mechanisms.",

To do this, the lab is developing novel experimental and computational technologies at the intersection of microscopy, genomics, and synthetic biology. His group is applying these tools to learn organisational principles governing tissue development and cellular mechanisms of disorganisation during injury and disease.",

By combining lab techniques with mouse models and patient samples, we want to find out how cells switch their identity as a cancer starts, and how they diversify from one another while the cancer grows. We then use this knowledge to search for ways to manipulate these processes to treat cancer more effectively.",

We further study how the tissue microenvironment and stress conditions regulate morphodynamic migration plasticity and dynamic cell functions such as phagocytic activity. With our work we aim to address how developmental robustness and innate immune responses are established in the early embryo and how adaptive cell behaviours impact on disease processes such as cancer cell metastasis.",

To do this, cells need mechanisms to detect these physical limits, deform their cortex whilst producing mechanical force for forward locomotion and  orient themselves to move through tissues. We focus on understanding how the microtubule cytoskeleton and microtubule associated proteins regulate the movement of cells through physically challenging environments.",

In the first I will describe the unexpected dynamic complexity of sleep activity in the brain of a reptile. In the second, I will describe experiments on camouflage behavior in cuttlefish, an animal that exploits a unique skin display system controlled by the brain to match the texture statistics of visual scenes. Such studies, in animals that diverged over 320 and 550 MYA respectively from our own lineage, force one to reflect on the nature of common principles of brain operations.",

By understanding these processes they hope to reveal general principles contributing to cancer progression, to speed the development of new drugs, and to develop new strategies for regenerative medicine. To accomplish these goals they build, perturb, and model human tissues in vitro using techniques from the chemical, physical, and biological sciences.",
