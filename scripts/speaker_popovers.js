To do this, the lab is developing novel experimental and computational technologies at the intersection of microscopy, genomics, and synthetic biology. His group is applying these tools to learn organizational principles governing tissue development and cellular mechanisms of disorganization during injury and disease.',

By combining lab techniques with mouse models and patient samples, we want to find out how cells switch their identity as a cancer starts, and how they diversify from one another while the cancer grows. We then use this knowledge to search for ways to manipulate these processes to treat cancer more effectively.',
